# About Observer

Observer is a frontend for Arth Panel, a lightweight self-hosted Minecraft server panel. Observer is meant to be run as a docker container, and is made with HTML/CSS/JS, Node, SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI. For testing purposes, there is an instance of observer running at https://servers.arthmc.xyz/

## How to Run

1. Download the image from docker hub with the command `sudo docker pull arthmc/observer:latest`
2. Run the image with `sudo docker run -p 3000:3000 arthmc/observer:latest`. To change the port, replace the first 3000 with the port number you want.

## Other Requirenments

- By default, observer will connect to Arth's quartz backend. To create your own functioning service you will need to set up a [quartz](https://github.com/arthmc/quartz) backend.
- Arth Panel also uses a pocketbase backend to more securely manage accounts. By default it'll point to our pocketbase, but to start your own service you need to [setup](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase) your own.

## How to run without docker

1. Grab the source code with `git pull`
2. Install packages with `npm i`
3. Build the source code with `CI= npm run build`
4. Run with node build

## How to run a dev server

- Make sure you install the pagackes by running `npm i`
- To run a dev server, enter the command `npm run dev`
- If you need to mimic a production environment for something like working with Service Workers, enter `npm run preview` instead.

## Contributing Guidelines

- Please format your code with Prettier, or an alternative that achieves the same results.
- Please use [feather](https://feathericons.com) for svg icons & use webp for raster images whenever possible. If you're wondering what tools have been used to make images like the arth logo (seen on arthmc.xyz) and the favicon, they were made with Lunacy.

## Why Arth Panel?

The main difference between Arth Panel and an alternative like pufferpanel or pterodactyl is that it's meant to work in a way so that if an issue were to occur, you could easily just SSH into the machine and run the jar directly in a folder, so you know that your server's uptime is not dependant on a panel someone else made working flawlessly.

## Pages

```
/servers (Where all servers you have access too are listed)
/settings (Configure things like site URL)
/newserver (Page to create a new server)
/setup (Page for the panel owner to set everything up)
/pay (manage subscriptions)
/subscription-success (stripe redricts users to this page, which has a button to create a server)
/server/[server technicalname] (page showing eventually terminal)
/signin
```
