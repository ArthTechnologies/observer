# Observer

Observer is a frontend for Arth Panel, an open-source & self-hosted minecraft server panel. Observer is meant to be run as a docker container, and is made with HTML/CSS/JS, Node, SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI. 



# How to Run

The reccomended way to run observer is in a docker container. The name of the container is `diamonc/observer`. Make sure the default port (3000 by default) is forwarded. Quartz, our backend, will need to be running (as a docker container prefferably) as well for the panel to have function, but quartz is still in very very early developnment

### Check out our [backend](https://github.com/diamonc/quartz)'s progress  



## Why Arth Panel?
The main difference between an alternative like pufferpanel or pterodactyl is that it's meant to work in a way so that if an issue were to occur, you could easily just SSH into the machine and run the jar directly in a folder, so you know that your server's uptime is not dependant on a panel someone else made working flawlessly.  

## Planned Pages

```
/servers (Where all servers you have access too are listed)
/settings (Configure things like site URL)
/newserver (Page to create a new server)
/server/[server technicalname] (page showing eventually terminal)
/login
/signin
/account (manage account/profile)
/billing (add to your balance and view your balance as well as next charges)
```
