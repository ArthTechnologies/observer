# Observer

Observer is a frontend for Arth Panel, an open-source & self-hosted minecraft server panel. Observer is meant to be run as a docker container, and is made with HTML/CSS/JS, Node, SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI.  

## Planned Pages

```
/servers (Where all servers you have access too are listed)
/settings (Configure things like site URL)
/newserver (Page to create a new server)
/server/[server technicalname] (page showing eventually terminal)
/login (login or signup)
/account (manage account/profile)
/balance (add to your balance and view your balance as well as next charges)
```
